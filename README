my_calculator.py is the Normal Mode of the homework.

For Hard Mode, I tried several things, none of which really solved it. the file
heptest.py shows these efforts:

-- I manually added .wallet_value to the objects, and that worked, but of course
amounts to manual labor.

-- I used a FOR loop to pull all the .wallet_value numbers into a list, but
couldn't do any math on that.

-- I added @property over the wallet_value function.

-- I created a @wallet_value.getter method.

-- I tried a million ways of attaching "property" to the equation to tell it
to just look at the designated attribute of wallet_value.

-- I couldn't get my head around using a series of binary magic methods.
